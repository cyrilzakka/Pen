# Pen
Pen is a native MacOS application for the [Llama ðŸ¦™](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama) family of large language models. This app runs locally and is based on the C/C++ port by [Georgi Gerganov](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) with some help from [Jed Fox](https://github.com/j-f1).

## Getting Started
To get started you'll need access to the Llama weights which you can request [here](https://forms.gle/jk851eBVbX1m5TAv5). Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) to convert the model to C/C++. That's it!

## Todo
- [ ] Highlight generated tokens with a different color based on token probabilities
- [ ] Add support for Alpaca/Vicuna
- [ ] Add a Chat mode
- [ ] Isolate bug where model loading fails after launching the app.
